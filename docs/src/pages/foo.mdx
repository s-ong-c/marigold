## Hello World

The `<Aside>` layout is useful when you want to set two things next to each other and the one has a fixed width (the aside) and the other can have a dynamic width (the content).

It is important to note that the `<Aside>` must have exactly too children, where none is a `<Fragment>`.

Here you can switch the theme of the component.

```tsx preview
<Aside space="medium-1">
  <Box border="1px solid #ced4da" bg="#e9ecef" height="100px" width="50px" />
  <Box border="1px solid #ced4da" bg="#e9ecef" />
</Aside>
```
